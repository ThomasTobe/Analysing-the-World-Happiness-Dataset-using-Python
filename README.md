# Analysing-the-World-Happiness-Dataset-using-Python
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the World Happiness dataset. The analysis was performed using Python, leveraging popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides insights into various factors influencing happiness scores across different countries.

The EDA covers a range of analytical techniques, including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. It explores correlations between happiness scores and key variables such as GDP per capita, social support, health life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perception of corruption.

The findings highlight significant relationships between these variables and happiness scores, shedding light on the factors that contribute to overall happiness in different regions. The analysis also includes visualizations such as scatter plots, bar charts, and correlation heatmaps to enhance the understanding and presentation of the data.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for those interested in understanding the world happiness trends, exploring data analysis techniques, and gaining insights into the complex interplay between various factors and happiness scores.
